# Responses API samples
Originally launched by OpenAI and now natively supported in Azure AI Foundry, the Responses API combines the simplicity of the Chat Completions API with the advanced tool-calling capabilities of the legacy Assistants API. It offers a streamlined way to build powerful agentic experiences by allowing developers to structure prompts, invoke tools, and manage outputs - all within a single API call. This repo includes a selection of minimal Responses API Python samples covering the most of the common features:

# Why are there two sets of samples? Which API version should I use?
Starting in May 2025, you can now opt in to our next generation of v1 Azure OpenAI APIs which add support for:
- Ongoing access to the latest features with no need to update api-version each month.
- OpenAI client support with minimal code changes to swap between OpenAI and Azure OpenAI when using key-based authentication.

Code samples have been provided for both the v1 API Preview, and also the older API versions. The v1 API Preview samples have a v1.py suffix to distinguish them.

If you want the latest features, I would recommend using the v1 API Preview, with the `api-version` set to `preview`.
If you need a stable, GA version, and don't need the latest features, then you can use the older API. At time of writing, the latest GA API release is `2024-10-21`.

# Semantic Kernel 
As of 1.27, Semantic Kernel supports Responses API for both Azure OpenAI and OpenAI. The following samples provide examples for conversation history, plugins, Web Search (currently OpenAI only), File Search, vision, and Structured Outputs.

# Recommended settings

If you're coming to this for the first time, and want some suggestions for the most compatible/simplest way to try out the latest features, try the following:

- Model: gpt-4.1 [(see docs for a full list of supported models and versions)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/responses?tabs=python-secure#model-support)
- Region: East US2 or Sweden Central [(see docs for a full list of supported regions)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/responses?tabs=python-secure#region-availability)
- Deployment: Global Standard
- API version: v1 Preview
- If using the "Legacy" API version: 2025-04-01-preview
- OpenAI library 1.99.2 or above (ideally the latest stable release)
- Semantic Kernel 1.36.1 or above (ideally the latest stable release)

# Features currently unsupported on Responses API on Azure OpenAI
- web_search tool (Azure AI Foundry Agent Service recommended if web search is needed)
